# Enterprise Kafka Orders Platform -- <sub>End-to-End Kafka Setup with Docker, KRaft, and Python (Confluent Kafka)</sub>

## Overview

##### This repository provides a minimal yet enterprise-grade Apache Kafka platform demonstrating how modern organizations build event-driven applications using:

- Apache Kafka (KRaft mode, no ZooKeeper)

- Docker & Docker Compose

- Python Producers and Consumers

- Confluent Kafka client (librdkafka)

##### The project simulates a real enterprise workload:

- Order events produced by an application and consumed by downstream services.

#### Despite using a single Kafka node, the configuration mirrors real production architecture and can be scaled horizontally with minimal changes.
